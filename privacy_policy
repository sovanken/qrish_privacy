Privacy Policy for Qrish
Last Updated: June 18, 2025
Qrish is a QR code and barcode scanner app developed by Sovanken, designed with your privacy as our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use Qrish. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
1. What We Collect
Qrish collects minimal data to provide a fast and secure scanning experience. All data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers. Specifically, we collect:

Scan Content: Data from QR codes and barcodes you scan, such as URLs, contact details, or text, stored locally in the app’s database.
Image Processing: Images you upload for scanning are processed locally on your device and are not saved or stored after processing.
Timestamps: Date and time of scans to organize your scan history, stored locally.
App Preferences: Your settings (e.g., auto-open links, haptic feedback, sound effects) are saved locally to customize your experience.

2. What We Don’t Collect
We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not collect or process the following:

Personal Information: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information.
Image Storage: Uploaded images are processed immediately and not saved or stored anywhere.
Location Data: Qrish does not access or track your location or GPS information.
Analytics: We do not use analytics services or track your app usage.
Cloud Sync: Your scan history and data are never uploaded to cloud servers or shared with third parties.

3. How Your Data is Stored
All data collected by Qrish is stored securely on your device using the following practices:

Local Storage Only: Scan history, timestamps, and app settings are stored in a local database on your device, protected by your device’s security features.
App Sandbox: Data is isolated within the app’s sandbox, ensuring it is only accessible to Qrish and protected by your device’s operating system.
User Control: You can delete individual scans, clear all scan history, or reset app settings at any time through the app’s Data & Storage settings. Uninstalling Qrish removes all app data from your device.

4. Permissions We Request
Qrish requests minimal permissions to function effectively, and we only access what is necessary for the app’s features:

Camera: Required to scan QR codes and barcodes. No photos or videos are saved.
Photo Library (Optional): Used only when you choose to upload images for scanning. No images are saved or stored after processing.
File Access (Optional): Used only when you export your scan history as a CSV file, with your explicit permission.
Internet Access (Optional): Used only when you choose to open scanned URLs or share scan results, with no data sent to our servers.

5. How We Use Your Data
The data collected by Qrish is used solely to provide the app’s core functionality:

Scanning: To process and display QR code and barcode content.
History Management: To maintain a record of your scans with timestamps for easy reference.
Customization: To apply your preferences, such as enabling/disabling auto-open links, haptic feedback, or sound effects.
Exporting: To generate CSV files of your scan history when requested.

We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties, and no data is used for advertising or analytics.
6. Data Sharing and Third Parties
Qrish does not share your data with any third parties, except in the following cases:

User-Initiated Actions: If you choose to open a scanned URL, dial a phone number, or share scan content (e.g., via email or messaging apps), the relevant data is handled by the apps or services you select, outside of Qrish’s control.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose data if required by law or to comply with legal processes, but only to the extent necessary.

7. Children’s Privacy
Qrish is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has used Qrish, please contact us at dev.sovanken@gmail.com, and we will take steps to delete any related data.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Qrish’s features or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted in the app and on our website (if applicable), with the “Last Updated” date revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
